## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

A clean and simple tool to help shoppers compare specs for bikes. Most useuful for beginners or new riders as a way to compare power and price between different bikes. Utilizes an API to find price, seat height, displacement, horsepower. Displays the specs and an image of the bike. 

## Optimizations

Add a view that displays the specs for multiple bikes at once. Currently, the tool finds and displays specs for one bike at a time. 

Add ability to search for bike by common name. For example "Honda Rebel" vs "CMX300"
